<h1>Minimum Operations</h1>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:
