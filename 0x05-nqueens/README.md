# N Queens
### Algorithm
### Python

*The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access toresources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.*

## Concepts Needed:
1. __Backtracking Algorithms:__
    Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to aproblem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

2. __Recursion:__
    Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.

3. __List Manipulations in Python:__
    Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.

4. __Python Command Line Arguments:__
    Handling command-line arguments with the sys module. Command Line Arguments in Python.

*By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledgerequired to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not onlytests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn aboutalgorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.*
