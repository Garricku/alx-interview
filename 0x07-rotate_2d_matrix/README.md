# Rotate 2D Matrix

Concepts Needed:
Matrix Representation in Python:

Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.
In-place Operations:

Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
Matrix Transposition:

Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
Reversing Rows in a Matrix:

Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
Nested Loops:

Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
