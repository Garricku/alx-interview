# Prime Game
### Algorithm
### Python

*For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.*

## __Concepts Needed:__
## Prime Numbers:

- Understanding what prime numbers are.
- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

## Sieve of Eratosthenes:

- An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

## Game Theory:

- Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
- Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

## Dynamic Programming/Memoization:

- Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

## Python Programming:

- Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
- Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors:
	- vi
	- vim
	- emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable
